    <p>How do I get vaccinated against COVID-19?</p>
  </div>
  
  <p><a href = "https://vaccinefinder.org/search/">Vaccine Finder</a>
    is the most up-to-date national database of locations that offer COVID-19 vaccines. 
    When you use the tool, make sure to note: </p>
    <ul>
      <li> You'll need to contact a location directly to book an appointment before going, 
        either by phone or on their website (the Vaccine Finder tool does not allow 
        for appointment booking, only finding locations where vaccines are being offered).
      </li>
      <li>
        You'll also need to first confirm that you are currently eligible for COVID-19 
        vaccination in your state. To see if you are eligible, consult your state's current 
        guidelines. Most states have these posted online. There are also other 
        resources such as <a href = "https://www.nbcnews.com/specials/plan-your-vaccine/">
          Plan Your Vaccine
        </a> to help you get started.
      </li>
      <li>More data is being added every day about vaccination locations and availability. 
        Since information might be limited in some states while more providers and pharmacies 
        are being added, be sure to check Vaccine Finder regularly if you don't see 
        available vaccines near you yet.</li>

                As of February 27, 2021, large-scale (Phase 3) clinical trials are

<button type="button" class="collapsible"> ✨ Most Common Side Effects</button>
<div class="content">
<p>
        	In large clinical trials, most side effects have been minor. When side effects occur,
          they typically last just a few days.
        	For the authorized vaccines, common side effects include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Pain at the site of the injection
          </li>
          <li>
            Painful, swollen lymph nodes in the arm where the vaccine was injected
          </li>
          <li>
            Tiredness
          </li>
          <li>
            Headache
          </li>
          <li>
            Muscle or joint aches

          <li>
            Nausea and vomiting

  <div class="space-need">
    <p>
      While supplies are limited, if you are in one of the groups recommended to take the 
      vaccine, you will need to get whichever vaccine is available in your area. 
      It’s possible that in the coming months, as production increases and more vaccines 
      get approved for use, that people will have options for which shot to get.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bottom line is that every vaccine that is recommended by FDA and CDC has been 
thoroughly tested and found to be effective and safe.
    </p>
    <p>
      You’ll get a card or fact sheet at your vaccination site that will tell you about 
the vaccine and help you understand the details. Your card will tell you which kind of vaccine 
you get and when to get the second dose, if applicable.

          Vaccine manufacturers; the federal government; state, local,

          are getting to you as quickly as possible.

<button type="button" class="collapsible">✨ How much does it cost?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>COVID-19 vaccine is provided at 100% no cost to recipients. The federal government 
    is providing the vaccine free of charge to all people living in the United States, 
    regardless of their immigration or health insurance status.
     No one can be denied a vaccine if they are unable to pay a vaccine administration 
     fee.</p>
    </div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">✨ Do I need 1 shot or 2 shots?</button>
<div class="content">
  <div class="space-need">
    <p>
      All COVID-19 vaccines currently available in the United States have been shown to be 
    highly effective at preventing COVID-19.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines are given in two shots, one at a time and 
    spaced apart. The second shot of the Moderna vaccine should be given 28 days after your 
    t shot, and the second shot of the Pfizer vaccine should be given 21 days after your 
    first shot. If you are told you need two shots, make sure that you get both of them. 
    The different types of vaccine are not interchangeable, so your doctor or pharmacist 
    will help make sure you get the same type of vaccine for both shots if applicable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Johnson & Johnson/Janssen vaccine only requires one shot. As of April 13, CDC and 
    FDA have recommended a pause in the use of the Johnson and Johnson’s Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine 
    in the United States out of an abundance of caution. Doctors and other health experts are reviewing the 
    specifics and will continue to provide the latest information.
    </p>
    <p>
      The vaccines may work in slightly different ways, but all types of the vaccines will 
      help protect you. It takes time for your body to build immunity after vaccination, so 
      you might not get full protection until two weeks after your final shot for two-dose 
      vaccines, and your single shot for a single-dose vaccine.
      Ask your healthcare provider about tools (like V-safe) that can send you automated 
      reminders about getting your first and second shots at the appropriate time.
